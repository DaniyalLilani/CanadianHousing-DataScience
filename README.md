# Exploratory Data Science: Canadian Housing Market Analysis

## Introduction

In this project, we delve into the intricate world of the Canadian Housing Market, a topic of significant relevance to both investors and renters. The dynamics of the Canadian Housing Market play a pivotal role in shaping Government Policy, particularly concerning immigration and foreign investment. Our investigation is anchored in a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle, encompassing approximately 35,000 homes, with the latest update in October 2023.
